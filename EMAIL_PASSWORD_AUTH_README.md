# Email/Password Authentication Implementation

This document describes the email/password authentication feature that has been added to your Google Business Profile automation app as a backup authentication method.

## üéØ Overview

The app now supports **dual authentication methods**:
1. **Google OAuth** (existing) - For seamless Google Business Profile integration
2. **Email/Password** (new) - Reliable backup authentication method

## üöÄ Features Added

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added optional `password` field to the User model in Prisma schema
- Backward compatible with existing Google OAuth users

### 2. Authentication Configuration
- Enhanced NextAuth configuration with Credentials provider
- Secure password verification using bcrypt
- Maintains compatibility with existing Google OAuth flow

### 3. User Registration API
- New endpoint: `POST /api/auth/register`
- Email and password validation
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt with 12 salt rounds)
- Duplicate email prevention

### 4. Updated UI Components
- **Login page**: Now shows both email/password form and Google OAuth button
- **Signup page**: Registration form with email/password and Google OAuth options
- Clean separation with visual dividers
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation and loading states

### 5. Test Account
- Pre-configured test account for immediate testing
- Email: `john@doe.com`
- Password: `johndoe123`

## üîß How to Use

### For New Users (Email/Password)
1. Visit `/signup`
2. Fill in name (optional), email, and password (min 6 characters)
3. Click "Create account"
4. Automatically signed in after successful registration

### For New Users (Google OAuth)
1. Visit `/signup`
2. Click "Sign up with Google"
3. Complete Google OAuth flow

### For Existing Users
- **Google OAuth users**: Continue using Google sign-in as before
- **Email/Password users**: Use email and password to sign in
- Both methods work seamlessly on the same login page

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Security Features
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Input validation (email format, password length)
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
- Secure session management via NextAuth

### Database Migration
When deploying to production with a database:
1. The schema includes the new `password` field
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to apply schema changes
3. Run `npx prisma db seed` to create the test account

### Files Modified/Added
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added password field
- `lib/auth.ts` - Added Credentials provider
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - New registration endpoint
- `components/auth/login-form.tsx` - Enhanced login form
- `components/auth/signup-form.tsx` - Enhanced signup form
- `scripts/seed.ts` - Added test account with password

## üö® Important Notes

### For Production Deployment
1. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is properly configured
2. Run database migrations: `npx prisma db push`
3. Seed test data: `npx prisma db seed`
4. Both authentication methods will work simultaneously

### User Experience
- Existing Google OAuth users are unaffected
- New users can choose their preferred authentication method
- Clear visual separation between authentication options
- Consistent user experience across both methods

### Session Management
- Both authentication methods use the same session system
- Users have the same permissions regardless of authentication method
- Session persistence works identically for both methods

## üîç Testing

### Email/Password Authentication
1. Visit `/signup` and create a new account
2. Use the test account: `john@doe.com` / `johndoe123`
3. Try both registration and login flows
4. Verify session persistence

### Google OAuth (Existing)
1. Ensure Google OAuth still works as before
2. Test that existing users can still sign in
3. Verify new Google accounts can be created

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Users can access the app even if Google OAuth has issues
2. **Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred authentication method
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users experience no disruption
4. **Security**: Industry-standard password hashing and validation
5. **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface for both methods
